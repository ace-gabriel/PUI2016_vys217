# Geo-Spatial Analysis

For this assignment I worked with Achilles, Priyanshi, Aaron, Akshay, Kaylyn. I did most of the coding by myself. We discussed the meanings of the plots and maps together.

* The citibike data provided by Kashuk is already cleaned and used by him in the lab, and the same data is required for the assignment, so I have used the same cleaned data.

* The "import seaborn as sns" should be imported initially, however the boxplot is showing incorrect output(outliers not displayed) because of seaborn, thats why I have imported seaborn later after plotting the boxplots.

* While plotting the time series for the output of "statsmodel.tsa.seasonal_decompose", the graph is being plotted in wrong dimensions, however on re-executing the cell, the graph is plotted correctly
