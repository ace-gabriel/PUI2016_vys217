# Collaborators: I worked with Aaron Dsouza, Achilles Saxby, Priyanshi Singh, Anastasia Shegay and Akshay Penmatcha for this Homework.

## Assignment 1:

I cleaned the data and used references from the internet to work on this assignment.

I referred the Applied Data Science code for getting the ols function without creating a column of ones.

Most of my work was done individually and I assisted my collaborators with their assignment.

## Assignment 2:

I helped Aaron with the programming in this assignment. I also proofread the Authorea paper with was majorly written by Achilles Saxby.

The paper can be found on https://www.authorea.com/users/106123/articles/133483/_show_article 

# FBB feedback

good work on the analysis in place and tests appropriately chosen and performed.
please look at the comments on the Authorea article though. Mostly the issues are issues with the linguistics organization, and wording. I recommand you read a few articles, say 1/week, from science journals like PLOSOne to understand scientific writing a bit better.
